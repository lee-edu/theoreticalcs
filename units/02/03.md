**Encryption** is a way to hide information, and is key to keeping information safe. We will be implementing a very well known encryption algorithm: substitution ciphers. Though there are much more complicated and secure encryption methods, substitution ciphers are a great way to practice using data structures.

## Objectives
This lab is intended to **evaluate** your ability to:
  - use linear and associative structures to organize data
  - iterate through structures to analyze data
  - understand how substitution ciphers work

## Task
Submit your code and a write-up that addresses the following questions:

  1. Briefly explain what a substitution cipher is, and more specifically, what a rotation cipher is.
  1. How can we use frequency analysis to decrypt substitution ciphers?
  1. Why might frequency analysis not work?
  1. What is the decrypted message?

Materials can be found on Google Classroom.

## Academic Honesty
You *are* allowed to work with others on this lab, as long as you **do not** share any code! Please refer to [the syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus/) for more details.
