You've seen a very common example of a linear structure already: Arrays! There are some other linear structures that you should know; however, Lists are used much more common compared to Stacks and Queues.

## Stacks
A stack is a *mutable* data structure with **Last In, First Out** access.

> ⊕ peek, push, pop, top

## Queues
A queue is a *mutable* data structure with **First In, First Out** access.

> ⊕ peek, enqueue, dequeue, front, back

## Lists
A list is an *immutable* data structure. It is *recursive*; we will get a taste of **recursion** now while we are working with lists, but we will go more in depth later in the course!

You will be working with lists very often in Scala. Some techniques that will be useful to learn are **higher order functions** and **pattern matching**.

> ⊕ `Nil`, cons (`::`), concat (`:::`)  
> ⊕  map, filter  
> ⊕  match, case
