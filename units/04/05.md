## Objectives
The goal of this lab is to **evaluate** your ability to:
  - read and write DFAs
  - read and write Turing Machines
  - prove the correctness and efficiency of algorithms

## Tasks
  1. write a dfa 
  1. write a turing machine
  1. prove that the algorithm works
  1. prove the time and space complexity of the algorithm
  1. something more??
