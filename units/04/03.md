A **Turing Machine**, invented by Alan Turing, is another theoretical model of computation that is more complex than DFAs and NFAs. In fact, a Turing Machine can simulate *any* given computer algorithm, and is used to prove the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers.

## Representation
A Turing Machine consists of two main "parts": an infinite **tape** of symbols, and a **machine** that can read, write, and move the tape one symbol at a time. This machine keeps track of **states** and **transitions**, and can be visually represented with a graph, much like DFAs.

We will study how to read and write Turing Machine algorithms.
