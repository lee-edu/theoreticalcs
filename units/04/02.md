One use of graphs is to visually represent theoretical machines called **deterministic finite automata (DFA)**. DFAs are simple models of computation that fall under the broader category of **state machines**.

## Representation
You can represent a DFA using a directed graph; each vertex represents a **state**, and each directed edge represent a possible transition to another state. This graph represents the DFA's program, which either **accepts** or **rejects** an input string.

We will study how to use these graphs to write DFA algorithms.

## NFA
We will also quickly touch on **nondeterministic finite automata (NFA)**, which are very similar to DFAs. The difference is that each state can have multiple transitions for each input, as opposed to DFAs which can only have a *unique* transition for each input.
