We have established foundational concepts for computer hardware; now we will talk about how to write programs. We can't simply pass a directed graph to a computer -- we must provide instructions that it understands.

## Machine Language
**Machine language** is the language that a computer "understands". We will look at examples of machine language programs, but we will not write any of our own. All programs are must be **compiled** into machine language before they can be executed.

## Assembly Language
**Assembly language** is slightly easier for humans to read, but it can still be confusing. It provides some very useful abstractions that a programmer can utilize.

We will use [Commodore 64][c64] to study assembly language.

how do we write and represent algorithms for an actual computer?
