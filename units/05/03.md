Now that we've had a taste of assembly language, we have a better idea of what our computer actually does when we execute a computer program. This knowledge will help us analyze our code in a much more sophisticated manner that what you might have been doing previously.

## Debuggers
A *very* common occurence in computer science is: your code doesn't work! What strategies have you used to **debug** your code?

We will study how to use a helpful tool called a **debugger**. Specifically, we will be using a program called **GDB**.
