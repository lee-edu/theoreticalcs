We've now had plenty of practice designing and writing algorithms for theoretical models of computing. However, we don't use these models in real life! Let's translate the concepts we've learned into actual hardware.

## Computer Organization
What are the parts of a computer, and how are they designed to store information and execute programs? How can we think of our programs in terms of these lower level concepts?

> ⊕ high vs low level  
> ⊕ CPU, registers  
> ⊕ memory, storage, random vs sequential access  
> ⊕ input/output, bus
