To complement being able to store our data in different structures, we should also be able to sort and organize our data so that we can find what we're looking for quicker. Searching and sorting are crucial algorithms that should be in every computer scientist's toolbox.

## Sorting
There are many different ways to sort a linear data structure. We'll examine several different algorithms and compare the advantages and disadvantages of each one.

  > ⊕ bogo, bubble  
  > ⊕ selection, insertion  
  > ⊕ merge, quick

## Searching
How does sorting enable faster searching? We'll examine two searching algorithms.
